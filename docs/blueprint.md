## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: HSL(47, 90%, 50%) which converts to a golden yellow (#F0BA27), embodying trust and prosperity, which aligns with the financial activities the app enables.
- Background color: HSL(47, 20%, 90%) which converts to a very light tan color (#F2EDE4).
- Accent color: HSL(17, 70%, 55%) which converts to a muted orange (#D16A31) for highlighting interactive elements and calls to action.
- Font pairing: 'Belleza' (sans-serif) for headlines, 'Alegreya' (serif) for body text. The former font conveys fashion, art, and design; the latter font conveys elegance, intellect, and a contemporary feel.
- Use clear and concise icons to represent different service categories (plumbing, electric, etc.) and actions (submit, filter, message).
- Prioritize a clean, card-based layout to display demands and proposals. Use white space effectively to avoid clutter.
- Employ subtle transitions and loading animations to enhance user experience, indicating system activity and changes.
